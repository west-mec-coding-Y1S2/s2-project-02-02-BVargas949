           In the next section, using header,paragraph,unordered lists and lists, I was able to create body paragraphs that explain the cost of certain events. "The strong" tag was also used to give the money symbol a bold look. The header was used to seperate the sections from each other.

        <h1>What Your Support Does</h1>


        <p>
            Every 10 minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. Her first reaction is fear and confusion. Support is just a phone
            call or mouse click away. Our free services offer a friendly ear and expert guidance to anyone dealing with this
            life-threatening illness.
        </p>

            in the 1-Mile Walk for Hope.

        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
            Since its inception in 2004, Diane's Run has grown from a purely local event involving 100 runners to a signature Wyoming
            event with more than 2000 participants annually. The event is enormously effective in spreading the message that
            breast cancer need not be fatal if caught early enough with mammography and breast self-exam. As well as a top-flight
            athletic event, Diane's Run is an emotionally moving event attracting many first timers and recreational runners.
            This event provides all of us with the opportunity to spread a hopeful message about breast cancer to our families
            and our communities.
        </p>

        <h2>Remembering Diane</h2>

        <p>Diane's Run is named in remembrance of Diane Wheaton, mother of 2 and wife of Peter, who passed away in May, 2003.
            Diane was an outspoken advocate of physical fitness and healthy living. She was an inspiration to all who knew
            her and continues to be an inspiration to the thousands of runners who have participated in this event.
        </p>

        <p>
            We hope you can join us this year and become part of the Diane's Run family.
        </p>
